{"reviewFull": "My all-time #1 movie, and the inspiration for the color theme and logo of this blog. The movie has all my favourite sci-fi elements: virtual reality, innovative tech, computer hacking by a team of renegades on the run from a deadly enemy, shootouts, and amazing special effects which were totally groundbreaking at the time. And all over the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic future. Any one of these features would get me interested in a movie, but The Matrix really hits the sci-fi jackpot by weaving them all so essentially into the plot."}
