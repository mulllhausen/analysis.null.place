{"reviewFull": "This is one of my all time favourite movies. It's a lesser known sci-fi/detective noir type film, so if you haven't seen it and you like those genres then I would definitely recommend it.\nI remember the movie perfectly as I have seen it so many times, so I don't need to include any spoilers to remind myself about it. But suffice to say that this is a film that keeps the viewer guessing what is going on right until the end. The music is great, the settings are excellent - murky and dark - right up my alley. And there really isn't anything else quite like the plot, that I have come across."}
