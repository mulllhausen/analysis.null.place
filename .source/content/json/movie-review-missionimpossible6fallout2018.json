{"reviewFull": "An anarchist wants to contaminate the Siashen Glacier at the base of the Nubra River valley in Kashmir with plutonium in order to \"end the old order\" by starving 1/3 of the world's population, because, as his manifesto goes, \"the greater the suffering, the greater the peace\". Not a well thought out thesis really, but Ethan and the IMF team's attempts to thwart it makes for a good action movie.\nThere are some excellent car/motorbike chase scenes around some famous places in Paris - the Arc de Triomphe roundabout, etc. And some decent free-running in London. I guess they used CG to do the car/motorbike chase scenes in Paris, since I doubt they could have closed off such busy places in the middle of the day to film the movie. But it was very well done - certainly fooled me."}
