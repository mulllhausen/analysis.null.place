{"reviewFull": "For me, there were about 3 seconds worth of real fear in total in this movie. These came from various sudden appearances of the ghost of La Llorona (the crying lady): either when she grabbed people with her freaky hand, or when it showed her face hidden behind her decrepit wedding dress veil. Going by IMDB reviews I was expecting much worse, and this may have pushed my score higher."}
