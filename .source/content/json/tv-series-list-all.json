            "review": "As both a <i>Game of Thrones</i> fan, and a sci-fi fan, I had to check out this show (its based on the book by George R. R. Martin). Its not up there with <i>Game of Thrones</i> but it was still an entertaining sci-fi with some original ideas.\nWe enter the story after the Nightflyer spaceship has already left Earth, bound for the <i>Volcryn</i> - a mysterious object which they believe to be of alien origin. The Earth is dying and the hope is that the Volcryn will be able to help humanity survive. The journey through space takes up the entire show and is fraught with mishaps. It turns out that the ship has a consciousness of its own - Cynthia, the mother of captain Eris, uploaded her mind into the ship's computers before she died. She is against the mission from the start as she fears the Volcryn will destroy the ship, and she does everything she can to sabotage their progress. She disables engines, cranks up the climate control, and even tries to turn the ship around. The ship is fitted with holographic projectors, and Cynthia uses these to \"haunt\" various crew members with depictions of their loved ones begging them to turn back and abort the mission. Furthermore, all video calls from the ship back to Earth are handled by the ship's computer, and it is not clear whether the ship is altering their messages en route to mess with their minds. Under these circumstances, the crew struggle to maintain a grip on reality.\nA lot is left unexplained in the show. We are told that the Earth is dying but no details are given as to how or why. We also never really get to see whether their mission to communicate with the Volcryn is successful. They do reach it, in the final minutes of the final episode, but all we see is the ship flying into what appears to be an electrified nebula and then suddenly the ship is empty of human life, and one of the main characters (Karl) is back on Earth reunited with his wife and dead daughter. Did the Volcryn bring his daughter back to life? And teleport the whole crew back to Earth? Or is this <i>what might have been</i> and in reality the Volcryn just zapped them all into oblivion?",

            "reviewTitle": "What if the 80s never ended but just became more Japanese?",
            "review": "There's no way I can review this show without giving spoilers. Owen (Jonah Hill) is the schizophrenic son of a wealthy family who has to lie for his brother in court. This puts him under considerable stress. Annie (Emma Stone) has borderline personality disorder and is hooked on pills that enable her to vividly relive the final day she spent with her dead sister. Owen needs money so he joins a dodgy clinical trial overseen by a sentient computer named GRTA. Annie is running out of her pills and the only way to get more is to join the trial. The two become friends during the course of the clinical trial as they assist each other in a series of induced lucid dreams.\nThis show is billed as a comedy but I would not describe it as such. It had some funny moments, and both the setting and the plot were bizzare and surreal, but that didn't make me laugh out loud.\nThe best thing about this show was the 80s alternate reality. The computer interfaces are all command-lines, with the occasional green-on-black graph. Apparently they never invented the GUI in this universe. Its a very interesting premise. Could such a world exist? Was the invention of the GUI inevitable?\nThe fusion of Japanese culture into everyday American life was also well done and believable. For example, to induce the participants not to drop out of the clinical trial, the overseers threaten them with bringing dishonour and shame upon themselves. There are a few Japanese style mascots and I think I even heard a station jingle as they are being given the certificates at the end of the trial.",
