            "review": "I love this movie, I have seen it a few times and every time it's just as good. It really gets me thinking what it might be like if aliens were to visit Earth. Would we even be capable of understanding how their technology worked? And what would be the social and political consequences of the visit?\nUnlike most movies of this genre, these aliens do not have the desire to fight humanity; in fact humans are the clear aggressors - locking them up in a detention camp (slum) and testing out their own energy weapons on them like guinea pigs. Very few of the aliens even know how their own technology works, which is believable, given that most humans don't know how a computer or a jet engine work.",

            "review": "Set in 2054. The side effect of a now-banned drug is that addicts have given birth to children who dream of real future events - specifically future crimes. Police use these dreams to stop crimes before they even occur, and as a result, violent crime has become virtually non-existent. I'm writing this review from memroy after having seen this movie many times over the years. The scene that stands out the most in my memory is the large glass computer screen that Tom Cruise uses to analyse the dreams and hunt for clues to solve the crimes. He looks like the conductor of an orchestra as he smoothly swipes around capturing still images from the video, moving them to the edge for inspection, twisting imaginary knobs to speed up or slow down the video speed, etc.\nDeterminism vs free will is a major theme. The movie sides with the determinist viewpoint and does so very elegantly. When a dream appears foretelling of the protagonist committing a murder, he vows not to do it, but a series of random events lead him to his unavoidable fate.",

The movie has all my favourite sci-fi elements: virtual reality, innovative tech, computer hacking by a team of renegades on the run from a deadly enemy, epic shootouts, and amazing special effects which were totally groundbreaking at the time. And all this over the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic future.

            "reviewTitle": "A conservative rebel?",
            "review": "My review of this movie is particularly critical because of its highly acclaimed status. The USA Library of Congress added it to their <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/\">National Film Registry</a> in 1990 as a sample of American film heritage, and described it as a film that <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/descriptions-and-essays/\">\"spoke to a whole generation and remains wrenchingly powerful, despite some dated elements\"</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_without_a_cause\">the critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave it 96%</a>, concluding that it \"is a searing melodrama featuring keen insight into '50s juvenile attitude and James Dean's cool, iconic performance.\" Were it not such a renowned movie then perhaps I would have looked harder for redeeming elements, but as it was, I just took it at face value.\nActing standards were definitely lower back in the 50s. Infact, of the leading roles, only James Dean (Jim) and Jim Backus (Jim's dad) can act. Not that they are brilliant actors either - they just pass as believable for the roles they are playing. The rest either overact (by being unrealistically hysterical or shouty) or come across as actors uninvolved with their role - just regurgitating their lines with no idea of what it would be like to be the character they are playing. The bad acting definitely detracted from the plot, which I found quite unique and thought-provoking.\nThe movie is a coming-of-age film in which the hero, Jim, is one of the few \"virtuous\" people in a sea of spineless phonies. His concept of virtue is clearly that of a typical 1950s man. He believes:<ul><li>in defending his honour from those who call him a coward</li><li>in facing his fears and not showing his peers that he is afraid</li><li>that a man must be the head of the household (\"...if [dad] had guts to knock Mom cold once, then maybe she'd be happy and then she'd stop pickin' on him, because they make mush out of him.\")</li><li>that the weak should be protected from predators by the strong</li><li>that people should be sincere when talking about serious matters</li><li>in taking responsibility for his own actions</li></ul>\nHe does some rebellious things too I suppose - driving a stolen car off a cliff, getting drunk as a teenager, getting into a knife fight - but these acts of rebellion are all done in furtherance of the aforelisted 1950s virtues, which hardly seem rebellious. The real <i>rebel without a cause</i> in this movie is Jim's nihilistic nemesis Buzz, who goads Jim into a knife fight by stabbing his car tyre, and then challenges him to a game of \"chickie run\" (driving stolen cars off a cliff and jumping out at the last second). When Jim asks him why on earth they would want to do such a thing, Buzz carelessly replies, \"you gotta do something, dontcha?\". But Buzz is not the rebel the movie is titled after - Jim is. As the plot develops, and Jim the traditionalistic hero vanquishes Buzz the nihilist, the movie comes across as an attempt to reaffirm the social conservative values of the day, which were losing ground in the 1950s to ideas such as atheism and nihilism.\nI first watched this movie about 10 years ago, and thoroughly hated it. I just couldn't get past the bad acting, bad sound mastering, and abominable brass soundtrack. But I thought I'd better re-watch it before writing this review, just in case I missed something the first time around. This time it did keep me engaged. The ethical conundrums Jim finds himself in are gripping, so some kudos is warranted there. The movie becomes more entertaining if you think what you would do in his situation. Also, I quite enjoyed unravelling the movie's philosophy - a weird attempt to smuggle socially conservative values across as acts of rebellion. That was probably not the kind of entertainment the director had in mind for his audience, but still, it was my takeaway.",

I won't be specific since this review does not contain spoilers, but suffice to say that if there had been a little more mystery at the end the it would have made the movie probably on par with the matrix 1 for me. This could pretty much have been done by simply removing all the flashback cuts - they were corny and they made me feel disrespected as a viewer. The explanations spoken at the end would already have been enough to piece together what was happening, and if not then the mystery would have made this movie amazing!",

Not a well thought out thesis really, but Ethan and the IMF team's attempts to thwart it makes for a good action movie.\nThere are some excellent car/motorbike chase scenes around some famous places in Paris - the Arc de Triomphe roundabout, etc. And some decent free-running in London.

Then for the following first half of the movie it appeared to be a glowing appraisal of the McDonald's brand and system of producing hamburgers. Only in the final half did it get into the dirty business dealings of Ray Kroc. I have no idea how true the story is, but it comes across as believable.\nThe movie was fascinating, despite the fact that the main character is fairly unlikeable.

Tips are legal but a percentage is not? Good to know I guess. She decides not to plea bargain with the FBI (wise) and avoids jail (lucky). Though the state still takes a large chunk of her money.

            "review": "The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack, which was somewhat dated house/disco.\nThe movie is split into two fairly disjointed halves. The first half follows the aspirations of the pimp Sergio Morra as he attempts to secure himself a role in the EU parliament. He rents a mansion across the bay from president Silvio Berlusconi and throws a lot of parties with beautiful women in the hope of enticing the president. The first half is basically softcore porn. The music is great and the timeline jumps around, which kept me entertained wondering where it was currently at.\nThe second half follows Berlusconi as he re-enters politics by bribing 6 senators to sway the vote his way. Sergio's attempts to woo the president are unsuccessful - he does catch the president's eye with his parties, and ends up throwing Berlusconi a party, but the president wants nothing to do with him personally.\nThis movie would probably make more sense to me if I knew more about Italian politics. I watched it with my girlfriend, mum and grandma and we were wondering afterwards whether it portrayed Berlusconi in a bad enough light or not. To those in the know, maybe the movie even comes across as damage control? He is unashamedly corrupt, but gives the justification that all men in his position are. The movie only alluded to his dealings with the Mafia - it never gave details. And not knowing much about Berlusconi, I can't say if it downplayed his character there. Overall the movie portrayed him as a fairly likeable character - he never loses his temper, smiles quite a lot and is generally good humoured. But of course that is not enough to redeem his criminal acts.",

            "review": "So many good ideas in this movie! Apparently aliens have come to earth and they cause visions that strike so much fear into the people who see them that they immediately kill themselves out of pure fear. Except for the insane, who find the visions enjoyable.\nIn typical horror fashion, we never get to see exactly what it is that scares people to the point of suicide. The protagonists blindfold themselves to avoid seeing the alien visions, and the director takes full advantage of this fact - frequently showing us a dark screen of the view through the blindfolds, instead of the aliens. I was wondering why this is such an effective horror technique. I think it's because each viewer has their own unique fears, so if the movie were to be more specific then some viewers would find it very scary but others not so much. But by showing the physical symptoms of the the fear on characters who we have come to empathise with, the movie can conjure the scariest of each of our thoughts.\nAt one point we do see some pencil drawings by one of the insane people who enjoys the alien visions. They are all different. One was some kind of tentacle monster coming out of a wormhole, one looked like a skeleton, and one looked a bit like Cthulhu. We only see these for a moment, and the fact that there were many different indistinct drawings still leaves the viewer to focus on what they find most scary.",

It's a pleasure to watch Neeson ruthlessly step from one meticulously deduced clue to the next as he zeros in on his prey.\nI watched this straight after watching <a class=\"link-to-other-media\" href=\"/movie-reviews/#!themanfromnowhere2010\"><i>The Man from Nowhere</i></a> just to compare the two, since the plots are quite similar. Both heros are special agents, and both must rescue a young girl from kidnappers. Both movies build up a high level of stress, yet the techniques they use are noticeably opposite. Whereas the in <i>The Man from Nowhere</i> the music in the fight scenes is grave and ominous, the fight scenes in <i>Taken</i> have very quick camera shots and the music is tense with high pitched strings over a staccato bass. In both movies, the final boss's weapon of choice is the karambit knife, which has to be more than coincidence. <i>The Man from Nowhere</i> came out after <i>Taken</i> so director Lee Jeong-beom must have been a fan of <i>Taken</i> director Pierre Morel's work.",

            "review": "Japanese seem to go in for very slow paced movies. This one was too slow for me, though I did still enjoy the plot and character development. The story is of a group of 4 people living in poverty in a single room with an old lady they call Grandma, though only two of them are actually her granddaughters. One day they rescue a 5 year old girl who is sitting outside an apartment in the freezing cold. She has been abused by her parents so they decide she can live with them. They do not inform her parents and there are reports of her being kidnapped on the news. The working age adults in the family survive by working in menial jobs - construction and laundry - and supplement their income with shoplifting.\nAs the movie progresses, we see how the members of the family care for each other, which is a big contrast to the other relationships in the movie, where people are cold and distant. This part was the main vibe of the movie and I really enjoyed it - despite their shoplifting, which I do not approve of.\nGrandma eventually dies and they bury her beneath the house.\nTowards the end, the kid gets caught shoplifting and the whole family is discovered and brought in for questioning by the police.\nThis is a frustrating, but realistic part of the movie, because the police do not ask the right questions. For example, to the little girl, rather than asking, \"who would you rather live with?\" or, \"were you scared to be kidnapped?\" instead they simply assumed she would like to be reunited with her abusive parents.\nThe sister was put in prison for 5 years for incorrectly disposing of a corpse! It's called burying someone! The location should not matter, so long as it is done with love and is not going to contaminate the groundwater. Plenty of cultures do bury their relatives in the back garden, for example in the Cook Islands.\nOverall I quite enjoyed this movie - hence the the 4 stars. It had a great vibe up until the end, where it just became frustrating. But even then, it was a realistic kind of frustrating - hopefully this will challenge viewers to think critically about the system they live in.",

            "reviewTitle": "Romance on the go",
            "review": "I saw this Filipino romcom/drama in a cinema full of Filipino women, which I definitely recommend if you want the most immersive experience. There was loud sobbing coming from somewhere near the front row during the sad scenes and screams of laughter in the flirty/funny scenes - I think they enjoyed it as much as a rollercoaster.\nThe story is about Joy Fabregas as she works in Hong Kong while waiting for her Canadian visa. It is an experience familiar to many Filipinas - emigrating to a western country where they can use their nursing degree to send money back home. Visas are very expensive - especially on a HK or Filipino salary - so Joy has to work two jobs, which is illegal on her HK visa. With the long hours she barely has time to eat, let alone for romance. Add to that the stress of running from the deportation police, and her mother's domestic abuse and you might think this would be a pretty heavy movie. But that is not the case - overall it remains light hearted and positive. Joy even manages to squeeze in the time to fall in love.\nThis is a nice movie to watch both for fun and to get an idea of the precarious existence of many Flipinas as they emigrate to the west. I'm only deducting a star because the romantic music-video style scenes towards the end were too corny for me.",

The kids decide to give him a Viking funeral by floating him out to sea on a makeshift raft, dousing it in petrol, and setting fire to it. How does modern society respond to a Viking funeral? Not well hahaha. A child welfare officer comes to assess the kids and their funeral gets page 1 in all the newspapers.",

            "reviewTitle": "Nazi brutality vs the perfection of Chopin",
            "review": "This movie was on TV the other night. I was keen to watch it because it is so famous and I hadn't seen it before. In fact, I always avoided Jewish atrocity movies when I was younger because I couldn't bear to watch the inhuman way the Nazis treated the Jews in WW2. I used to find the othering and consequent violence and disrespect just too sad and stupid to devote any of my time to. These days my feelings haven't changed, but I have come to see the value of preserving and retelling the horrible history of the human race - to prevent history from repeating.\nThe Pianist really emphasises the brutality of the Nazis by contrasting it with the beauty and skill of the Jewish protagonist's piano playing. The Nazis force Jews to walk in the gutter, hit them in public for no reason, conduct ad-hoc firing squads on the street and eventually comit genocide on them. These acts would be despicable enough out of context, but when they are juxtaposed against such beauty then it makes them seem far worse. This was especially true for me as I love Chopin's music - which the protagonist plays so perfectly at various points throughout the story.",
