However there were some flashbacks at the end that took it from a 10/10 down to a 9/10 for me. I won't be specific since this review does not contain spoilers, but suffice to say that if there had been a little more mystery at the end the it would have made the movie probably on par with the matrix 1 for me. This could pretty much have been done by simply removing all the flashback cuts - they were corny and they made me feel disrespected as a viewer. The explanations spoken at the end would already have been enough to piece together what was happening, and if not then the mystery would have made this movie amazing!", "reviewTitle": "A great movie but it babies the viewer at the end", "year": 2018, "thumbnail": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NzcyMjM5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk2NzAyNTM@._V1_SY209_CR0,0,140,209_.jpg"}, {"rating": 1, "title": "aaa"}, {"rating": 1, "title": "zzz"}]
