{"reviewFull": "This movie got terrible reviews, so I was expecting it to be pretty bad. Maybe that negatively anchored me and that's why I liked it so much - because it was so much better than I was expecting. I loved the ancient Egyptians and the way that any minor improvement in weaponry/transport (arrows and boats) had such a huge survival advantage. I also thought that the massive reliance on religion to explain a largely unknown world was very well done."}
