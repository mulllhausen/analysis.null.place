{"reviewFull": "I love this movie, I have seen it a few times and every time it's just as good. It really gets me thinking what it might be like if aliens were to visit Earth. Would we even be capable of understanding how their technology worked? And what would be the social and political consequences of the visit?\nUnlike most movies of this genre, these aliens do not have the desire to fight humanity; in fact humans are the clear aggressors - locking them up in a detention camp (slum) and testing out their own energy weapons on them like guinea pigs. Very few of the aliens even know how their own technology works, which is believable, given that most humans don't know how a computer or a jet engine work."}
