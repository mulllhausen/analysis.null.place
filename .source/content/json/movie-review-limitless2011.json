{"reviewFull": "I find this movie very inspirational. The premise of a pill that makes you super smart is cool, but it's the creative uses that Bradley Cooper's character (Eddie) puts his newfound intelligence to that are so inspiring. I guess I just enjoy seeing people who are driven and creative succeeding in life. Plus he has a lot of fun doing so, which keeps it lighthearted.\nIt was also a nice touch how Eddie is able to remember minute details from his past and use them to piece together current events. The script writers did a great job thinking of how super intelligence might actually play out."}
