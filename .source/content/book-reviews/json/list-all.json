            "reviewTitle": "Philosophizing on start-ups",
            "review": "An interesting book that discusses the nature of start-ups and the surrounding business ecosystem. This book should not be read as an instruction manual, but rather as a high-level guide to help entrepreneurs find their niche.\nWhen I started this book I made the mistake of taking it too literally. Peter Thiel writes using big sweeping non-falsifiable statements regarding the nature of business and technology, as well as giving his predictions about the future. To analyse such statements is impossible and if you try this, you'll find this book a frustrating experience. Instead, you should glean the big ideas from this book and see if they ring true or not.\nIt may not be clear why I say this, so here is an example of how not to read this book: take the opening statement of the book, \"Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not create an operating system.\" Taken literally of course this is true - in fact every moment in history happens only once - even a robot performing a repetitive task does each iteration at a new point in time. But from the context, the author is not talking in a strictly literal sense about physics. He is talking about new inventions. But different businesses do often create similar technologies - MySpace and Facebook, Windows and Linux, EVs and fossil fueled cars. Depending on the focus of a technology it may appear new or old, for example modern EVs use Lithium ion batteries - that's new, but then still have the traditional 4 wheels, a chassis, seats, etc.\nThe central premise of the book is that creating something new is \"0 to 1\". This rings true. Despite the fact that a new invention tends to build upon old technologies, there is always a unique idea present that previously did not exist. It is often just a clever way of combining existing technologies - eg. the electric drill (hand drill + electric motor). Nevertheless, because the invention is new, something has come into being that did not previously exist. In rare cases a new technology can even come about via simplification - like how the unicycle was developed by removing a lot of parts from a bicycle and reconfiguring the rest. So \"0 to 1\" may not be the best term to describe the phenomena of invention, but it gets across the broad point.\nChapter 1 proposes a question to help entrepreneurs develop a unique business idea: \"What important truths do very few people agree with you on?\". This is an interesting way to come up with controversial ideas, many of which will doubtless be groundbreaking. But in my opinion a new  invention need not be controversial to be successful and to push humanity forward. I remember many technologies invented during my lifetime that were widely expected to succeed and did indeed succeed - for example the DVD player, electric vehicles, and the digital camera. Of course, the most memorable new inventions are more controversial - the first aircraft, the internet, artificial intelligence in certain contexts, etc. But the world needs solutions to mundane problems as well as grandiose ones, so I would say not to limit oneself to the question \"What important truths do very few people agree with you on?\" when developing a start-up idea. Maybe a better question would be, \"What useful thing do you see missing from the world?\". But then, Peter Thiel has far more experience with start-ups than I do, so maybe he's onto something.\nChapter 2 discussed asset bubbles, but in my opinion completely missed the mark. Bubbles always have the same underlying financial cause - an abundance of cheap credit.\nChapter 3 contained a lot of good material. It discusses the necessity of profits, rather than revenues in business and how aiming for monopoly status is the surest way to achieve this. This is because competition tends to eliminate profits over time. Controversially Thiel claims that monopolies are not only good for the company in question, but also for consumers, since they create something new of value. In my opinion, this misses the critique that most economists have of monopolies. The question is not so much whether they improve the world, but whether the world would be even better with more competition.\nAnd personally I think that to ask whether monopolies are good or bad is a bit of a red herring. There are more fundamental ethical criteria that ought to be applied to business, and so long as these are satisfied then we can say that the resulting business is at least \"not bad\" (though this would not necessarily mean it is good either). Here are a few examples of the hundreds of such criteria I would apply:<ul><li>Don't use the legal system to gain an advantage in business</li><li>Interest rates should not be used as a tool to promote one type of business over another</li><li>Copying an idea is good - it shares knowledge and results in technological progress</li></ul>And of course, the world today does not operate upon these principles, so its hard to say if monopolies would emerge if it did.\n\nTo be continued...",

            "reviewTitle": "Minimalist sci-fi",
            "review": "Points for creativity and originality. I liked the conscious \"plasmic\" ocean concept. And the idea that an alien might not communicate with humans in a way that could ever make sense to us. Also points for character development and plot development. Snout initially appears crazy and then circumstances show him to be the sanest of them all. It was nice to have one's prejudices conjured and then corrected and it was nicely done. I also liked the air of mystery - things left unsaid: we never learn what visitors Snout and Sartorious receive, yet we are given snippets of conversations and evidence of bloody struggles, with little said about what went down. Further points added for the protagonists thoughts becoming material realities visible to others.\nHowever, I deducted points for a bit of a bland plot taking place all in one location (though it is a very interesting location - a foreign planet). At times it almost felt like the author was trying to be deliberately minimalistic - to see how interesting a book he could write using as little change in location and as few characters as possible.\nThe book raised some interesting philosophical questions and proposed some novel scientific methods for practically answering them - how do you know if you are dreaming? Try calculating something using a computer that would be beyond the capabilities of your brain, but easy for a computer. Though this is not foolproof since if you are dreaming you might just think the answer is correct, even if it is completely made up by your brain.\nI deducted further points when Kelvin brings up <i>god</i> in the final chapter. It seemed unnecessary and corny. Snout says, \"that's bad philosophy. It's even bad mysticism\" then changes his mind. I think his original reaction was correct. Though maybe it says something about the weakness of the human mind to always fall back on the tired old trope of a god, whenever some organism that is more intelligent or unexplainable is encountered.\nThis was definitely a book that made sense the second time around, but not the first.",

            "reviewTitle": "Medical memoir",
            "review": "A fascinating read (well actually I listened to the audiobook) of neuroscientist Barbara Lipska's brush with insanity. She mysteriously develops 18 brain tumours, descends into insanity, and then eventually makes a full recovery.\nI found the book pleasantly educational, yet still accessible to someone who knows very little about the workings of the human brain. We learn that as Barbara's brain expands, it pushes onto her brainstem, initially causing a slight loss of vision, but eventually resulting in whole range of horrifying symptoms:<ul><li>She becomes uncharacteristically irritable and picks fights with her loved ones</li><li>She is unable to stop eating chocolate</li><li>She becomes very impulsive (eg. she pisses herself in public!)</li><li>Memory loss - she forgets how to get home from places she has visited frequently before</li><li>She develops bad spatial awareness and crashes her car</li><li>She loses the ability to do multiplication and division, but surprisingly retains the ability to do addition and subtraction</li><li>She loses the ability to understand spatial terms like \"do a loop\" (in the context of driving)</li></ul>\nObviously it is a rare case when someone recovers from 18 brain tumours. The ultimate cause of Barbara's remission is unknown, but no doubt it lies in some combination of the strategies she tries: She undergoes many different treatments - chemotherapy, experimental immunotherapy treatment, and various drugs to mitigate side effects of other drugs. She also exercises like mad the entire time, even competing in a 5k race during her chemotherapy and placing 4th in her age group! Furthermore, she and her immediate family are all experts in the area of her illness, and they leave no stone unturned as they scour medical journals and experimental procedures in search of a cure. And finally she is rich enough to be able to afford the expensive treatments.\nI deducted 1 star because the protagonist focuses so much on her medical details and symptoms that she forgets to humanise herself. No time is spent at the start of the book acquainting us with Barbara's normal behaviour. Instead, we launch straight into her descent into madness. And sure, this technique makes the book immediately exciting, however it also makes it impossible to fully empathise with the protagonist. As a result, throughout the book she constantly has to explain when her behaviour is out of character. Whereas if she had built up an immersive experience of her normal life at the start then such explanations would barely be necessary - readers would be able to identify for themselves when her behaviour was out of character.",

            "review": "<p>I used to enjoy reading some of my brother's textbooks when he was doing his Bachelor of Psychology. This one tied together a lot of ideas I had gathered intuitively through life, built upon them, and organised them into a cohesive framework. Since it is such a useful book I have taken notes on it and included them here, for personal reference.</p><p>The first 8 chapters cover the foundations of logic, argumentation, psychological biases and fallacies, using plenty of real-world case studies. The book then introduces the <b>SEARCH</b> formula - a critical thinking framework for analysing any kind of claim - ranging from mundane to paranormal:</p><ol><li><b>S</b>tate the claim as specifically as possible without using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word\">weasel words</a>. It is important to avoid these, since they make arguments appear specific or meaningful, while actually being ambiguous and allowing the person proposing the claim to later deny any specific meaning when the claim is challenged.</li><li><b>E</b>valuate the claim using reason and/or evidence: Did it actually happen? If not then consider why. Was the claim a sound argument? A sound argument involves premises and a conclusion that must follow solely from the premises. Premises must be known facts.</li><li>Consider <b>A</b>lternative hypotheses. Humans have a lot of inbuilt biases. For example, our brains are good at pattern recognition, but we often latch on to a pattern that seems correct without ever testing it (doing this is known as confirmation bias). We have many other kinds of biases inherent in our brains too, however this does not mean we are doomed to ignorance. There are philosophical tools we can use to overcome our biases. The best way to avoid confirmation bias is to search for disconfirming evidence. Having an open mind means being willing to consider any possibility and changing your view in light of good reasons.</li><li><b>R</b>ate, according to the <b>C</b>riteria of adequacy, each <b>H</b>ypothesis:<ul><li>Testability - can the hypothesis be tested? Is there any possible way to determine whether the hypothesis is true or false? If a claim is not testable then it does not mean its false - it means it is worthless. Hypotheses that are testable are preferable to those that are not.</li><li>Fruitfulness - Does the hypothesis yield observable surprising predictions that explain new phenomena? Those that do are preferable to those that do not.</li><li>Scope - How many different phenomena can the hypothesis explain? The more the better.</li><li>Simplicity - is the hypothesis the simplest explanation for the phenomenon? Generally, the simplest hypothesis that explains the phenomenon is the best. For a hypothesis to be the simplest then it must make the fewest assumptions.</li><li>Conservatism - Is the hypothesis consistent with well founded beliefs? I.e. is it consistent with empirical evidence and with knowledge we have from verifiable scientific experiments? If the hypothesis conflicts with a highly confirmed theory then the hypothesis must be regarded as improbable until good evidence shows that the hypothesis is right and the theory is wrong.</li></ul></li></ol><p>These 4 steps are a general guide for assessing any claim. You might not always be able to discard a claim, or to tell if a claim is definitely true, but you can always weigh it against other claims and see which one stacks up best.</p>",

            "reviewTitle": "Ancient Roman political intrigue",
            "review": "This masterpiece of a book brings to life the early career of Roman politician Marcus Tullius Cicero as he rises through the ranks of Rome's political system to become:<ul><li>A lawyer (Rome's second best)</li><li>Aedile (equivalent to a government Minister today)</li><li>Praetor (Magistrate of the Extortion Court)</li><li>Consul (equivalent to President today)</li></ul>\nYou might think that reading about a politician who lived over 2000 years ago would be boring and irrelevant, but for me at least, this book was the complete opposite. Cicero's political ambitions are both exciting and surprisingly similar to those of politicians today. He is extremely ambitious, and carefully plans every move and each political alliance. If he thinks a person will help him advance his career then he does them a favor, with the expectation of it being returned at a later date. And if a person is not useful to him then he blows them off, regardless of how just or unjust their cause may be. His approach to politics is that it is not a fight for justice, but a profession.\nThe first half of the book focuses on Cicero's prosecution of the corrupt Governor of Sicily - Gaius Verres. Cicero hopes to win this court case partly because in so doing he will take Veres' rank (as was the Roman tradition), and partly to gain the favor of the Roman citizenry who will then elect him as an Aedile of Rome. Veres' crimes are so monstrous, and Cicero is such a rousing orator, that his court case becomes \"the greatest show in town\". In the end Veres flees the city. Having won over the plebeians, Cicero is elected Aedile. His new-found popularity also gains him a lot of business in his legal practice.\nThe second half of the book is about Cicero's struggle to become Consul. He already has the support of the plebeians, so his main challenge lies in convincing the aristocracy to vote for him - a <i>new man</i> (ie. a non-aristocrat). He discovers a secret plot by his rival for Consul - Lucius Sergius Catilina - and uses this information to his advantage. Catilina and his friends plan to take key positions in the senate and then introduce a land reform bill to sell vast amounts of Roman land, and annex Egypt. The aristocrats find this prospect so distasteful that they vote Cicero in as Consul purely to thwart Catilina's bill.\nI have always thought of ancient Rome as one of the most brutal societies - with its cruicifixions, floggings, beheadings and slavery - and this book does confirm that; however I was quite surprised to discover that both democracy and the rule of law were also strong aspects of ancient Roman society. I do find it strange that such a violent society was constructed so deliberately and with the approval of the general population. In this aspect I think many modern societies have improved since ancient Rome.",
