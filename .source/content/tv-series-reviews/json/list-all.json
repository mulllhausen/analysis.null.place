            "review": "Being both a <i>Game of Thrones</i> fan, and a sci-fi fan, I had to check out this show (its based on the book by George R. R. Martin). Its not up there with <i>Game of Thrones</i> but it was still an entertaining sci-fi with some original ideas.\nWe enter the story after the Nightflyer spaceship has already left Earth, bound for the <i>Volcryn</i> - a mysterious object in outer space which they believe to be of alien origin. The Earth is dying and the hope is that the Volcryn will be able to help humanity survive. The journey through space takes up the entire show and is fraught with mishaps. It turns out that the ship has a consciousness of its own - Cynthia, the mother of captain Eris, uploaded her mind into the ship's computers before she died. She is against the mission from the start as she fears the Volcryn will destroy the ship, and she does everything she can to sabotage their progress. She disables engines, cranks up the climate control, and even tries to turn the ship around. The ship is fitted with holographic projectors, and Cynthia uses these to \"haunt\" various crew members with depictions of their loved ones begging them to turn back and abort the mission. Furthermore, all video calls from the ship back to Earth are handled by the ship's computer, and it is not clear whether the ship is altering their messages en route, just to mess with their minds. Under these circumstances, the crew struggle to maintain a grip on reality.\nA lot is left unexplained in the show. We are told that the Earth is dying but no details are given as to how or why. We also never really get to see whether their mission to communicate with the Volcryn is successful. They do reach it, in the final minutes of the final episode, but all we see is the ship flying into what appears to be an electrified nebula and then suddenly everyone on the ship is gone, and the main character is back on Earth reunited with his wife and dead daughter. Did the Volcryn bring his daughter back to life? And teleport the whole crew back to Earth? Or is this <i>what might have been</i> and in reality the Volcryn just zapped them all into oblivion?",

            "review": "There's no way I can review this show without giving spoilers. Owen (Jonah Hill) is the schizophrenic son of a wealthy family who has to lie for his brother in court. This puts him under considerable stress. Annie (Emma Stone) has borderline personality disorder and is hooked on pills that enable her to vividly relive the final day she spent with her dead sister. Owen needs money so he joins a dodgy clinical trial overseen by a sentient computer named GRTA. Annie is running out of her pills and the only way to get more is to join the trial. The two become friends during the course of the clinical trial as they assist each other in a series of induced lucid dreams.\nThis show is billed as a comedy but I would not describe it as such. It had some funny moments, and both the setting and the plot were bizarre and surreal, but that didn't make me laugh out loud.\nThe best thing about this show was the 80s alternate reality. The computer interfaces are all command-lines, with the occasional green-on-black graph. Apparently they never invented windowing in this universe. It's a very interesting premise. Could such a world exist? Was the invention of windowing inevitable?\nThe fusion of Japanese culture into everyday American life was also well done and believable. For example, to induce the participants not to drop out of the clinical trial, the overseers threaten them with bringing dishonour and shame upon themselves. There are a few Japanese style mascots and I think I even heard a station-jingle as they are being given the certificates at the end of the trial.",

Well according to this hillarious TV show anyway.\nMeg, Nicky and Usman spend all their time playing, talking and thinking about Kingdom Scrolls - an MMORPG.

            "review": "I have been a fan of <i>Black Mirror</i> since the first season came out in 2011 on the UK's Channel 4. Since then the series has been bought by Netflix and has gradually been toned down. In my opinion (and I think I'm not alone here), the first couple of seasons and the <i>Christmas Special</i> under Channel 4 were the most harrowing. Initially, Netflix released their fair share of traumatizing episodes too - <i>Shut Up and Dance</i>, and <i>Nosedive</i> spring to mind. But Netflix also introduced some episodes that were neither sick nor twisted. In fact they were not even tragedies - they actually had happy endings. I'm thinking of <i>San Junipero</i> and <i>Hang the DJ</i>. My guess is that Netflix looked at their view counts and found that these episodes brought in a large new crowd of viewers who didn't want to see dystopian futures but who liked a good love story with a happy ending. And now <i>Season 5</i> is almost entirely in that vein. Its out of character with what I had come to love and expect from <i>Black Mirror</i>, so straight up I'm deducting half a star. We've got two episodes with happy endings and one that is tragic, but certainly not twisted. It feels like Netflix are playing it pretty safe and pandering to the mainstream, which is a shame because <i>Black Mirror</i> always used to be a show that set the trend for existential angst - audience be damned.\nAll that said, I still really enjoyed this season. The stories were inventive and the acting was superb. I liked the episode with Miley Cyrus in a coma the most - <i>Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too</i>. <i>Striking Vipers</i> (two straight dudes making out in a VR video game as a man and a woman) came in a close second. <i>Smithereens</i> I was not such a fan of. The hostage situation was tense - well directed and well acted - but in the end the plot and the underlying message were a bit of a nothingburger; so I'll deduct half a star there too.",

            "reviewTitle": "An invitation to fantasize",
            "review": "I get the feeling that this Amazon Prime TV series was created to rival Netflix's Black Mirror. Both fall under the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_fiction\">paranoid sci-fi</a> genre, and both have episodes with unrelated plots. However Electric Dreams is much more varied than Black Mirror - both in setting and in mood. There are episodes with people living on remote planets, episodes with aliens, some episodes are set in the future and some feature humans with superpowers. And whereas in Black Mirror, futuristic technology was always the weapon used to deal the fatal blow (at least in the early Channel 4 seasons, anyway), in Electric Dreams the futuristic technology is generally just another part of the setting.\nMany of the episodes left me wondering whether the events they depict could ever be real. Could a large factory ever contain only 4 employees? Could robots outlive the human race? Could spacecraft one day roam the galaxy giving tours, long after planet Earth has become uninhabitable? Nothing shown in the episodes seems quite impossible, but everything is beyond the horizon of what we will see in our lifetimes. The show invites the viewer to fantasize, and when combined with the surreal graphics and eerie music this makes for a very hypnotic and dreamy mood.\nMy favourite episodes were <i>Autofac</i>, <i>The Commuter</i> and <i>Kill All Others</i>. The rest of the episodes were decent too, except for <i>Crazy Diamond</i>, which I found a bit bleak and boring.",

            "review": "I have watched all the seasons of <i>Rick and Morty</i> (as I am writing this, there are 4 seasons) and the first is still my favourite. It seems to me that the writers used up most of their creative ideas and comedy on the first season.\nLike most people who watched the show, my initial thought was that it was just going to be a parody of <i>Back to the Future</i> - because of the similarities between the characters' names - Marty and Morty, Rick and Doc Brown, and Jennifer and Jessica. But <i>Rick and Morty</i> is far more bizarre and hilarious than a simple parody of <i>Back to the Future</i> could ever be!\nManipulative alcoholic mad scientist Rick drags his cowering young grandson Morty on harrowing adventures through time and space. Rick manipulates Morty into sticking alien drugs up his butt, tells him that he has a neutrino bomb and will use it to destroy the human race, gets Morty so tired that he inadvertently fondles his (male) math teacher's chest in class, and that's all just the first episode! Apparently a lot of fans did not like the pilot but I loved the whole of this season - it hit the ground running and never slowed down. Here is the synopsis of each episode:<ol><li>Pilot - see above.</li><li>The family pet dog enslaves humanity while Rick and Morty are off <a href=\"/movie-reviews/inception-2010/\">incepting</a> Morty's math teacher so he can get an A.</li><li>Rick creates an amusement park inside the body of a hobo while Jerry's parents come over for Christmas.</li><li>Sigerian scammer aliens use a simulation to try and trick Rick into giving up his recipe for concentrated dark matter. Meanwhile Jerry has the best day of his life interacting with NPCs who he thinks are real people in the simulation running at 5% capacity.</li><li>Rick gives Beth, Jerry and Summer a box that produces a guy called Mr. Meeseeks who solves any problem he is given, while he and Morty go on an adventure to steal treasure from a giant in the clouds.</li><li>Rick makes Morty a love potion to get Jessica to fall in love with him, but the whole world ends up falling in love with Morty. Rick turns everyone into praying mantises to try and undo their infatuation but it doesn't work, so Rick and Morty permanently migrate to another dimension where their dopplegangers recently died. They have to bury them in the backyard.</li><li>Morty fathers a Gazorpazorp son with a sex robot while Rick and Summer visit the Gazorpazorp homeworlds.</li><li>Rick updates the family's cable TV with programming from every conceivable reality. They stumble upon hilarious shows such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_LJtG2gXSc\">Gazorpazorpfield</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb31ysSl13o\">Two Brothers</a>. Meanwhile the family uses goggles Rick invented to observe an alternate dimension where Jerry is a famous actor and Beth is a surgeon.</li><li>Summer gets her first job at a shop run by the Devil that stocks only cursed items and Jerry gets abducted by aliens from Pluto who want it to become a planet again.</li><li>The Transdimensional Council of Ricks haul Rick and Morty to the Citadel of Ricks to find out why 27 Ricks have been murdered. Meanwhile Jerry hangs out with a Rick from another dimension who actually likes him.</li><li>Rick, Morty and Summer throw a party while their parents go away on a Titanic-themed getaway. The episode is a loose parody of <a href=\"/movie-reviews/risky-business-1983/\">Risky Business</a>.</li></ol>",

This BBC mini-series met all three of these criteria, yet the highest praise I could muster after watching it was, \"it's alright\".<ul><li>The plot unfolded just a bit too slowly to keep me engaged.</li><li>The characters were one-dimensional and unrelatable, so I didn't get emotionally invested in their survival.</li><li>It felt like there weren't quite enough people populating the scenes.</li><li>The show never even alluded to what was going on in other parts of the country or the world. I know the book doesn't cover that, but I would have liked to see how people in other countries handled the alien invasion. The series deviated from the book already, so such an explanation was certainly on the table.</li></ul>That covers the majority of the negatives. But the series also had positives:<ul><li>The architecture and smog of 1910s Britain seemed realistic. London was a real filth-hole, and that was before the aliens invaded!</li><li>The juxtaposition of futuristic Martian tech with 1910s British weaponry was well done. The Martian tech was not indestructible, but clearly much more advanced.</li><li>The levitating \"meteorites\" raining fire upon bystanders was intense and surreal.</li><li>I wasn't expecting the aliens to look like 3-legged spiders. That was imaginative.</li><li>Despite the devastation of the alien weaponry, characters still died from trivial things like being crushed by a falling wall, or dehydration.</li></ul>\nSo all up, not a terrible rendition of H.G.

Initially James plans to kill Alyssa but instead he falls in love with her and kills a famous philosopher who tries to rape her.\nThis is a British drama/dark-comedy. Not the type where you actually laugh much, but instead where you occasionally do a kind of snicker-exhale while thinking, \"I'm glad that's not my life\".\nI got a strong <i>Pulp Fiction</i> vibe from the show, which makes sense, since it is based on a graphic novel:<ul><li>The narrative is linear, so you feel like you are living in the spur of the moment with the protagonists - reacting as you face life's gritty hurdles head-on together.</li><li>The show is also very raw. It's like the directors went out of their way to emphasize the less glamorous parts of life:<ul><li>The protagonists wear badly fitting clothes, no obvious make-up, don't bother to keep their hair neat and their bodily imperfections are proudly displayed (eg. James' scrawny figure, or Alyssa's eye-bags).</li><li>Most of the scenes take place in very plain surroundings rarely shown in movies, such as a scraggly field, a rundown house by the coast or a dingy street in a poor neighborhood.</li><li>No attempt is made to hide the cold and grey UK weather.</li><li>The dialogue is also very plain, and awkward silences are common.</li></ul></li></ul>\nI'm a fan of <i>Pulp Fiction</i> and I really enjoyed this show.

James spent a long while in hospital recovering from the gunshot wound he sustained at the end of season 1 and is now stalking Alyssa. A new character, Bonnie, is plotting to kill them both as revenge for James' murder of her lover - the famous philosopher from season 1.\nI found this season much less exciting than season 1, for 3 closely related reasons:<ol><li>Adult responsibilities. In season 1 James and Alyssa were not yet adults, but in season 2 they are. I was expecting that as adults their lives would be more exciting - after all they should now be free to go wherever they like, live with whoever they want, and generally pursue their dreams. But it turns out that adulthood also comes with new responsibilities, and completely ditching these seems to be too costly for them. One of the best things about season 1 was that they were kids playing at adulthood - they got all the benefits of being adults, but none of the costs. Stealing a car was fun and illegal - now they could go wherever they liked - but as kids they were given leniency when they were caught. They also had no jobs to be fired from if they did not show up. In season 2 most of that youthful abandon is gone - replaced with lots of sighing and going to work.\n</li><li>Their slightly downcast attitude. In season 1 James and Alyssa clearly felt empowered, but in season 2 their mood is subdued. They have been caught and punished for the crimes they committed in season 1; and while they do try to emerge defiant from this process, it is clear that their spirits have been somewhat dampened. This comes across partly from their body language and partly from things they say during the flashback voiceovers in episode 2. James describes his physical rehabilitation in hospital by saying, \"I felt like I was being punished. And maybe I deserved it.\" And Alyssa, who is always quick to describe anything she finds even mildly distasteful as \"SHIT!\" merely comments that her community service \"wasn't as bad as going back to school.\"\n</li><li>From predators to prey. In season 1 they were masters of their own destiny -  roaming the country, breaking into houses and stealing whatever they wanted. Not only is there none of this behaviour in season 2, but now they are being actively hunted by Bonnie who intends to murder them both.</li></ol>\nIn summary, the relationship our protagonists had with power in season 1 has been inverted in season 2, and it's just not so much fun to watch.",
