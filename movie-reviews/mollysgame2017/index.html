Fairly closely based on reality too, according to Wikipedia. A bit of an Oceans 11 vibe in the first half where she is living the high life. Ultimately she gets screwed by civil asset forfeiture, and laws against taking a percentage of the pot. Tips are legal but a percentage is not? Good to know I guess. She decides not to plea bargain with the FBI (wise) and avoids jail (lucky). Though the state still takes a large chunk of her money. Her getting screwed over by various powerful people - her father, her first boss, her clients, the NY mob, the FBI - is a big theme, and it\u0027s frustrating to watch. Cinematically excellent though and excellent acting too.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": 5, "ratingValue": 4}, "url": "https://analysis.null.place/movie-reviews/mollysgame2017/"}</script>
