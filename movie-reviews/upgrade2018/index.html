However there were some flashbacks at the end that took it from a 10/10 down to a 9/10 for me. I won\u0027t be specific since this review does not contain spoilers, but suffice to say that if there had been a little more mystery at the end the it would have made the movie probably on par with the matrix 1 for me. This could pretty much have been done by simply removing all the flashback cuts - they were corny and they made me feel disrespected as a viewer. The explanations spoken at the end would already have been enough to piece together what was happening, and if not then the mystery would have made this movie amazing!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": 5, "ratingValue": 4.5}, "url": "https://analysis.null.place/movie-reviews/upgrade2018/"}</script>
