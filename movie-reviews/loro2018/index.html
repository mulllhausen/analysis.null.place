The first half follows the aspirations of the pimp Sergio Morra as he attempts to secure himself a role in the EU parliament. He rents a mansion across the bay from president Silvio Berlusconi and throws a lot of parties with beautiful women in the hope of enticing the president. The first half is basically softcore porn. The music is great and the timeline jumps around, which kept me entertained wondering where it was currently at.\nThe second half follows Berlusconi as he re-enters politics by bribing 6 senators to sway the vote his way. Sergio\u0027s attempts to woo the president are unsuccessful - he does catch the president\u0027s eye with his parties, and ends up throwing Berlusconi a party, but the president wants nothing to do with him personally.\nThis movie would probably make more sense to me if I knew more about Italian politics. I watched it with my girlfriend, mum and grandma and we were wondering afterwards whether it portrayed Berlusconi in a bad enough light or not. To those in the know, maybe the movie even comes across as damage control? He is unashamedly corrupt, but gives the justification that all men in his position are. The movie only alluded to his dealings with the Mafia - it never gave details. And not knowing much about Berlusconi, I can\u0027t say if it downplayed his character there. Overall the movie portrayed him as a fairly likeable character - he never loses his temper, smiles quite a lot and is generally good humoured. But of course that is not enough to redeem his criminal acts.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": 5, "ratingValue": 3.5}, "url": "https://analysis.null.place/movie-reviews/loro2018/"}</script>
