{"reviewFull":"\"Dysfunctional\" family goes to visit granddad (Billy Connoly) in Scotland for his birthday. Granddad takes the kids to the beach and dies while taking a nap. The kids decide to give him a Viking funeral by floating him out to sea on a makeshift raft, dousing it in petrol, and setting fire to it. How does modern society respond to a Viking funeral? Not well hahaha. A child welfare officer comes to assess the kids and their funeral gets page 1 in all the newspapers."}
