{"reviewFull":"Don Shirly, a virtuoso pianist (previously known to me as Remy from <i>House of Cards</i>) tours the deep south during the Jim crow era with Tony Lip, a hard-bitten Italian bouncer turned valet (Aragorn from <i>Lord of the Rings</i>). The main theme is racism and we see dozens of examples ranging from police enforcing curfew laws to a concert hall proprietor who refuses to let the star of the performance eat in his white-only restaurant. These scenes obviously make for a movie which is very uncomfortable in parts, however this is contrasted with Tony's gradual shedding of his racism as they progress on the road. I found it quite a thought provoking movie - shining light on an era with which I am only vaguely familiar."}
