{"reviewFull":"The story of how the McDonald brothers get screwed out of a fortune by the ambitious milkshake-maker salesman Ray Kroc. I watched this movie without even reading the blurb and I initially thought it was a remake of <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, since Ray starts off barely scraping by selling milkshake makers. Then for the following first half of the movie it appeared to be a glowing appraisal of the McDonald's brand and system of producing hamburgers. Only in the final half did it get into the dirty business dealings of Ray Kroc. I have no idea how true the story is, but it comes across as believable.\nThe movie was fascinating, despite the fact that the main character is fairly unlikeable. His drive was admirable, but the ease with which he lied to his business partners, and used the inefficiency of the USA legal system to his advantage was not."}
