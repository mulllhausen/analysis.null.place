{"reviewFull": "Jim Carey is a great actor and if you like his comedy but have never seen him act in a drama then you're in for a treat. The plot is fairly complicated and I won't give spoilers here, but suffice to say that you'll probably want to watch this movie twice as it will make a lot more sense the second time around. The backwards music is one of the things that makes this movie so good IMO - it is playful yet somber and fits well with the theme (which I will not give away)."}
