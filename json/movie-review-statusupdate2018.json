{"reviewFull":"This is a movie aimed at children. I watched it on the plane and I should have paid more attention to the genre because I was expecting a movie for a slightly more mature audience. It was not a bad premise - whatever Kyle posts in his magic app on his phone comes true. However the things Kyle posts are so unimaginative. If you could post anything at all and it would come true then surely you would post something more interesting than, \"I have amazing dancing skills\". Post something like \"I live on top of a 300 floor skyscraper and get to school via waterslide\", or \"I can talk to animals\"."}
