It really gets me thinking what it might be like if aliens were to visit Earth. Would we even be capable of understanding how their technology worked? And what would be the social and political consequences of the visit?\nUnlike most movies of this genre, these aliens do not have the desire to fight humanity; in fact humans are the clear aggressors - locking them up in a detention camp (slum) and testing out their own energy weapons on them like guinea pigs. Very few of the aliens even know how their own technology works, which is believable, given that most humans don't know how a computer or a jet engine work.","reviewTitle":"The anthropology of an alien visitation","year":2009,"IMDBID":"tt1136608","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ5MzFjYWMtMTMwNC00ZGU5LWI3YTQtYzhkMGExNGFlY2Q0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"},{"rating":5,"genres":["Action","Crime","Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"title":"Minority Report","spoilers":true,"review":"Set in 2054. The side effect of a now-banned drug is that addicts have given birth to children who dream of real future events - specifically future crimes. Police use these dreams to stop crimes before they even occur, and as a result, violent crime has become virtually non-existent. I'm writing this review from memroy after having seen this movie many times over the years. The scene that stands out the most in my memory is the large glass computer screen that Tom Cruise uses to analyse the dreams and hunt for clues to solve the crimes. He looks like the conductor of an orchestra as he smoothly swipes around capturing still images from the video, moving them to the edge for inspection, twisting imaginary knobs to speed up or slow down the video speed, etc.\nDeterminism vs free will is a major theme. The movie sides with the determinist viewpoint and does so very elegantly. When a dream appears foretelling of the protagonist committing a murder, he vows not to do it, but a series of random events lead him to his unavoidable fate.","reviewTitle":"Exquisite philosophical sci-fi","year":2002,"IMDBID":"tt0181689","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI3YzZjZjEtMDdjOC00OWVjLTk0YmYtYzI2MGMwZjFiMzBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"},{"rating":5,"genres":["Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"title":"Dark City","spoilers":false,"review":"This is one of my all time favourite movies.

The first half follows the aspirations of the pimp Sergio Morra as he attempts to secure himself a role in the EU parliament. He rents a mansion across the bay from president Silvio Berlusconi and throws a lot of parties with beautiful women in the hope of enticing the president. The first half is basically softcore porn. The music is great and the timeline jumps around, which kept me entertained wondering where it was currently at.\nThe second half follows Berlusconi as he re-enters politics by bribing 6 senators to sway the vote his way. Sergio's attempts to woo the president are unsuccessful - he does catch the president's eye with his parties, and ends up throwing Berlusconi a party, but the president wants nothing to do with him personally.\nThis movie would probably make more sense to me if I knew more about Italian politics. I watched it with my girlfriend, mum and grandma and we were wondering afterwards whether it portrayed Berlusconi in a bad enough light or not. To those in the know, maybe the movie even comes across as damage control? He is unashamedly corrupt, but gives the justification that all men in his position are. The movie only alluded to his dealings with the Mafia - it never gave details. And not knowing much about Berlusconi, I can't say if it downplayed his character there. Overall the movie portrayed him as a fairly likeable character - he never loses his temper, smiles quite a lot and is generally good humoured.

Apparently aliens have come to earth and they cause visions that strike so much fear into the people who see them that they immediately kill themselves out of pure fear. Except for the insane, who find the visions enjoyable.\nIn typical horror fashion, we never get to see exactly what it is that scares people to the point of suicide. The protagonists blindfold themselves to avoid seeing the alien visions, and the director takes full advantage of this fact - frequently showing us a dark screen of the view through the blindfolds, instead of the aliens. I was wondering why this is such an effective horror technique. I think it's because each viewer has their own unique fears, so if the movie were to be more specific then some viewers would find it very scary but others not so much. But by showing the physical symptoms of the the fear on characters who we have come to empathise with, the movie can conjure the scariest of each of our thoughts.\nAt one point we do see some pencil drawings by one of the insane people who enjoys the alien visions. They are all different. One was some kind of tentacle monster coming out of a wormhole, one looked like a skeleton, and one looked a bit like Cthulhu.

Whereas the in <i>The Man from Nowhere</i> the music in the fight scenes is grave and ominous, the fight scenes in <i>Taken</i> have very quick camera shots and the music is tense with high pitched strings over a staccato bass. In both movies, the final boss's weapon of choice is the karambit knife, which has to be more than coincidence. <i>The Man from Nowhere</i> came out after <i>Taken</i> so director Lee Jeong-beom must have been a fan of <i>Taken</i> director Pierre Morel's work.","reviewTitle":"I will find you...

This one was too slow for me, though I did still enjoy the plot and character development. The story is of a group of 4 people living in poverty in a single room with an old lady they call Grandma, though only two of them are actually her granddaughters. One day they rescue a 5 year old girl who is sitting outside an apartment in the freezing cold. She has been abused by her parents so they decide she can live with them. They do not inform her parents and there are reports of her being kidnapped on the news. The working age adults in the family survive by working in menial jobs - construction and laundry - and supplement their income with shoplifting.\nAs the movie progresses, we see how the members of the family care for each other, which is a big contrast to the other relationships in the movie, where people are cold and distant. This part was the main vibe of the movie and I really enjoyed it - despite their shoplifting, which I do not approve of.\nGrandma eventually dies and they bury her beneath the house.\nTowards the end, the kid gets caught shoplifting and the whole family is discovered and brought in for questioning by the police.\nThis is a frustrating, but realistic part of the movie, because the police do not ask the right questions. For example, to the little girl, rather than asking, \"who would you rather live with?\" or, \"were you scared to be kidnapped?\" instead they simply assumed she would like to be reunited with her abusive parents.\nThe sister was put in prison for 5 years for incorrectly disposing of a corpse! It's called burying someone! The location should not matter, so long as it is done with love and is not going to contaminate the groundwater. Plenty of cultures do bury their relatives in the back garden, for example in the Cook Islands.\nOverall I quite enjoyed this movie - hence the the 4 stars. It had a great vibe up until the end, where it just became frustrating. But even then, it was a realistic kind of frustrating - hopefully this will challenge viewers to think critically about the system they live in.","reviewTitle":"Adopted family take care of each other","year":2018,"IMDBID":"tt8075192","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZmOTY0MDAtMGRlMS00YjFlLWFkZTUtYmJhYWNlN2JjMmZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODAzODU1NDQ@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"},{"rating":5,"genres":["Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"title":"Limitless","spoilers":true,"review":"I find this movie very inspirational. The premise of a pill that makes you super smart is cool, but it's the creative uses that Bradley Cooper's character (Eddie) puts his newfound intelligence to that are so inspiring. I guess I just enjoy seeing people who are driven and creative succeeding in life. Plus he has a lot of fun doing so, which keeps it lighthearted.\nIt was also a nice touch how Eddie is able to remember minute details from his past and use them to piece together current events. The script writers did a great job thinking of how super intelligence might actually play out.","reviewTitle":"Creative, lighthearted, and motivational","year":2011,"IMDBID":"tt1219289","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmViZGM0MGItZTdiYi00ZDU4LWIxNDYtNTc1NWQ5Njc2N2YwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_UY268_CR2,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"}]}
