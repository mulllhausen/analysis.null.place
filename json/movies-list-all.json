It really gets me thinking what it might be like if aliens were to visit Earth. Would we even be capable of understanding how their technology worked? And what would be the social and political consequences of the visit?\nUnlike most movies of this genre, these aliens do not have the desire to fight humanity; in fact humans are the clear aggressors - locking them up in a detention camp (slum) and testing out their own energy weapons on them like guinea pigs. Very few of the aliens even know how their own technology works, which is believable, given that most humans don't know how a computer or a jet engine work.","reviewTitle":"The anthropology of an alien visitation","year":2009,"IMDBID":"tt1136608","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ5MzFjYWMtMTMwNC00ZGU5LWI3YTQtYzhkMGExNGFlY2Q0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"},{"rating":5,"genres":["Action","Crime","Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"title":"Minority Report","spoilers":true,"review":"Set in 2054. The side effect of a now-banned drug is that addicts have given birth to children who dream of real future events - specifically future crimes. Police use these dreams to stop crimes before they even occur, and as a result, violent crime has become virtually non-existent. I'm writing this review from memroy after having seen this movie many times over the years. The scene that stands out the most in my memory is the large glass computer screen that Tom Cruise uses to analyse the dreams and hunt for clues to solve the crimes. He looks like the conductor of an orchestra as he smoothly swipes around capturing still images from the video, moving them to the edge for inspection, twisting imaginary knobs to speed up or slow down the video speed, etc.\nDeterminism vs free will is a major theme. The movie sides with the determinist viewpoint and does so very elegantly. When a dream appears foretelling of the protagonist committing a murder, he vows not to do it, but a series of random events lead him to his unavoidable fate.","reviewTitle":"Exquisite philosophical sci-fi","year":2002,"IMDBID":"tt0181689","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI3YzZjZjEtMDdjOC00OWVjLTk0YmYtYzI2MGMwZjFiMzBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"},{"rating":5,"genres":["Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"title":"Dark City","spoilers":false,"review":"This is one of my all time favourite movies.

This could pretty much have been done by simply removing all the flashback cuts - they were corny and they made me feel disrespected as a viewer.

Then for the following first half of the movie it appeared to be a glowing appraisal of the McDonald's brand and system of producing hamburgers. Only in the final half did it get into the dirty business dealings of Ray Kroc. I have no idea how true the story is, but it comes across as believable.\nThe movie was fascinating, despite the fact that the main character is fairly unlikeable.

The first half follows the aspirations of the pimp Sergio Morra as he attempts to secure himself a role in the EU parliament. He rents a mansion across the bay from president Silvio Berlusconi and throws a lot of parties with beautiful women in the hope of enticing the president. The first half is basically softcore porn. The music is great and the timeline jumps around, which kept me entertained wondering where it was currently at.\nThe second half follows Berlusconi as he re-enters politics by bribing 6 senators to sway the vote his way. Sergio's attempts to woo the president are unsuccessful - he does catch the president's eye with his parties, and ends up throwing Berlusconi a party, but the president wants nothing to do with him personally.\nThis movie would probably make more sense to me if I knew more about Italian politics. I watched it with my girlfriend, mum and grandma and we were wondering afterwards whether it portrayed Berlusconi in a bad enough light or not. To those in the know, maybe the movie even comes across as damage control? He is unashamedly corrupt, but gives the justification that all men in his position are. The movie only alluded to his dealings with the Mafia - it never gave details. And not knowing much about Berlusconi, I can't say if it downplayed his character there. Overall the movie portrayed him as a fairly likeable character - he never loses his temper, smiles quite a lot and is generally good humoured. But of course that is not enough to redeem his criminal acts.","reviewTitle":"Damage control for Berlusconi?","year":2018,"IMDBID":"tt6748466","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTAxNzU4ZjUtMTFkNy00MzM0LWExNmQtN2RjYTM0ZTExMGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIwNDY4NDI@._V1_UY268_CR3,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"}]}
