It really gets me thinking what it might be like if aliens were to visit Earth. Would we even be capable of understanding how their technology worked? And what would be the social and political consequences of the visit?\nUnlike most movies of this genre, these aliens do not have the desire to fight humanity; in fact humans are the clear aggressors - locking them up in a detention camp (slum) and testing out their own energy weapons on them like guinea pigs. Very few of the aliens even know how their own technology works, which is believable, given that most humans don't know how a computer or a jet engine work.","reviewTitle":"The anthropology of an alien visitation","year":2009,"IMDBID":"tt1136608","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ5MzFjYWMtMTMwNC00ZGU5LWI3YTQtYzhkMGExNGFlY2Q0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"},{"rating":5,"genres":["Action","Crime","Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"title":"Minority Report","spoilers":true,"review":"Set in 2054. The side effect of a now-banned drug is that addicts have given birth to children who dream of real future events - specifically future crimes. Police use these dreams to stop crimes before they even occur, and as a result, violent crime has become virtually non-existent. I'm writing this review from memroy after having seen this movie many times over the years. The scene that stands out the most in my memory is the large glass computer screen that Tom Cruise uses to analyse the dreams and hunt for clues to solve the crimes. He looks like the conductor of an orchestra as he smoothly swipes around capturing still images from the video, moving them to the edge for inspection, twisting imaginary knobs to speed up or slow down the video speed, etc.\nDeterminism vs free will is a major theme. The movie sides with the determinist viewpoint and does so very elegantly. When a dream appears foretelling of the protagonist committing a murder, he vows not to do it, but a series of random events lead him to his unavoidable fate.","reviewTitle":"Exquisite philosophical

loved the whole premise of this movie - I would not have changed a thing about the plot. However there were some flashbacks at the end that took it from a 10/10 down to a 9/10 for me. I won't be specific since this review does not contain spoilers, but suffice to say that if there had been a little more mystery at the end the it would have made the movie probably on par with the matrix 1 for me. This could pretty much have been done by simply removing all the flashback cuts - they were corny and they made me feel disrespected as a viewer. The explanations spoken at the end would already have been enough to piece together what was happening, and if not then the mystery would have made this movie amazing!","reviewTitle":"A great movie but it babies the viewer at the end","year":2018,"IMDBID":"tt6499752","thumbnail":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NzcyMjM5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk2NzAyNTM@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"}]}
