{"reviewFull":"This is one of those movies where <a class=\"link-external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCxm7cTpBAs\">the trailer</a> gives away almost all of the movie - so I would recommend just watching the trailer. If you really love the trailer and want more of the same then watch the whole movie.\nThe plot is very simple. Judy's mum and dad are demonologists and they have a room full of evil artifacts. They hire a babysitter for Judy while they go away for the night. Babysitter's friend wants to talk to her dead dad so she comes over and pokes around in the room of evil stuff, unlocking Annabelle's glass case. This causes all the objects to come to life and chase the girls around the house, attempting to kill them in various gruesome ways.\nFor me, only some of the artifacts in the movie were scary. The Ferryman dropping coins just didn't do it for me, and nor did the piano. But the wedding dress and Annabelle did get my spine shivering. By having a museum of evil objects the directors got to use a kind of blunderbuss-approach to fear-inducement - throw lots of different types of fear at the audience and some will land. But the problem with this approach is that the fear is diluted - some people find one thing scary, others find something else scary. Everyone gets, say, 40% afraid, but nobody gets 100%.\nOverall the movie was not bad. Probably a good one to have on in the background at a Halloween party."}
