            <title>movie reviews</title>
            <link>https://analysis.null.place/movie-reviews/</link>
            <description>I watch so many movies that I find myself forgetting what a given movie was about, whether I liked it or not, and even whether I have already watched it. So I have made this page to keep track of movies I watch - good and bad. Maybe you will also discover some good movies here too, or learn what to avoid, assuming you have similar tastes to me.</description>
