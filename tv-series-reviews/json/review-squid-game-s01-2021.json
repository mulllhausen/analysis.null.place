{"reviewFull":"Pretty obviously intended to be an allegory for modern economic life (capitalism, socialism, etc). Especially later in the season once the \"high rollers\" (VIPs) are introduced. +5 stars for a really addictive show, -1 star for mass murder, -0.5 stars for some characters lacking depth."}
