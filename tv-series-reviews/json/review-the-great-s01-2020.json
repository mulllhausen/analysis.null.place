{"reviewFull":"There's nothing quite like escaping into a quirky alternate history of the 18th century Russian royal family to de-stress at the end of the day. If you like the first episode then the remainder of the season is much the same - brazen, irreverent and playful. I've enjoyed Nicholas Hoult's acting since <a href=\"/tv-series-reviews/skins-2007/\">Skins</a>. And Elle Fanning puts on an equally good performance."}
