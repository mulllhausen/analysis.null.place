{"reviewFull":"As a sci-fi fan, I am prone to automatically bump up the rating of any sci-fi movie or TV series, since my imagination is easily captured by futuristic technology, post-apocalyptic landscapes and hitherto unseen foes. This BBC mini-series met all three of these criteria, yet the highest praise I could muster after watching it was, \"it's alright\".<ul><li>The plot unfolded just a bit too slowly to keep me engaged.</li><li>The characters were one-dimensional and unrelatable, so I didn't get emotionally invested in their survival.</li><li>It felt like there weren't quite enough people populating the scenes.</li><li>The show never even alluded to what was going on in other parts of the country or the world. I know the book doesn't cover that, but I would have liked to see how people in other countries handled the alien invasion. The series deviated from the book already, so such an explanation was certainly on the table.</li></ul>That covers the majority of the negatives. But the series also had positives:<ul><li>The architecture and smog of 1910s Britain seemed realistic. London was a real filth-hole, and that was before the aliens invaded!</li><li>The juxtaposition of futuristic Martian tech with 1910s British weaponry was well done. The Martian tech was not indestructible, but clearly much more advanced.</li><li>The levitating \"meteorites\" raining fire upon bystanders was intense and surreal.</li><li>I wasn't expecting the aliens to look like 3-legged spiders. That was imaginative.</li><li>Despite the devastation of the alien weaponry, characters still died from trivial things like being crushed by a falling wall, or dehydration.</li></ul>\nSo all up, not a terrible rendition of H.G. Wells' book, but also not one I'm eager to watch again."}
